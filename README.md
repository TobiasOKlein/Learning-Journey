# Learning-Journey 🚀

A structured technical laboratory documenting my evolution in Computer Science and Software Development. This repository serves as a centralized hub for my academic exercises, personal experiments, and professional growth.

## 🗂️ Proficiency Levels

To better organize my progress, I categorize my work into six distinct levels based on technical complexity and architectural depth:

- **Level 00 - Fundamentals:** Initial steps in new languages, basic syntax, primitive types, and environment setup.
- **Level 01 - Logic & Algorithms:** Focus on problem-solving, data structures, and algorithmic complexity.
- **Level 02 - Applied Basics:** Integration of external libraries, frameworks, and first steps into specific domains (e.g., Data Science, GUI, Web).
- **Level 03 - Architecture:** Projects emphasizing clean code, design patterns, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), and modular systems.
- **Level 04 - Specialization:** High-level implementations involving complex protocols, advanced machine learning models, or hardware-software integration.
- **Level 05 - Deep Tech:** Capstone projects, advanced mathematical simulations, and complex systems requiring significant research and development.
